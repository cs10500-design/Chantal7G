    <h1>Art and Painting</h1>
    <p>I love Art because,i am quite creative and love to spend my free time doing what i love.<br> 
      There are many different forms of Art, and my personal favourite is Drawing as it is classic,<br>
      and you can never go wrong with it. Below is a list of differents forms of Art.</p>

  <ol> 
    
  <li>Sketching</li> 
  <li>Shading</li>
  <li>Painting</li>
  <li>Sculpture</li>
  <li>Architecture</li>
  <li>Music</li>
  </ol>

    <p> Art was created as early as 40,000 BC with earliest forms of art found as cave draings and paintings.<br>
     Some of the oldest evidence points to even earlier, potentially Neanderthal art, with sites in Spain showing<br> 
     symbolic markings at least 66,700 years old. There are many fun facts about Art such as these below.  </p>

    <ul> 
    

    <li> The oldest known art is a cave painting in Indonesia that is over 40,000 years old</li>
    <li> he word "art" comes from the Latin word "ars," which means "skill".</li>
    <li>The Mona Lisa has its own mailbox at the Louvre because it receives so many love letters.</li>
    <li> Pablo Picasso’s famous sculpture "The Thinker" was originally a small figure intended for a larger work.</li>
