    <p> Art was created as early as 40,000 BC with earliest forms of art found as cave draings and paintings.<br>
     Some of the oldest evidence points to even earlier, potentially Neanderthal art, with sites in Spain showing<br> 
     symbolic markings at least 66,700 years old. There are many fun facts about Art such as these below.  </p>




    

    <ul> 
    

    <li> The oldest known art is a cave painting in Indonesia that is over 40,000 years old</li>

    <li>The Mona Lisa has its own mailbox at the Louvre because it receives so many love letters.</li>

    <p> One of my favourite forms of Art is,<b>Papier Mâché</b>,because it provides a satisfying <br> 
        creative outlet that engages multiple senses and skills. Paper mache is a craft technique that combines paper<br>
        and a binding agent like glue or paste to create strong, lightweight objects. It can be made by mixing shredded paper <br>
        into a pulp or by layering strips of paper soaked in paste over a form, which hardens once it dries. <br> 
        The term comes from the French for "chewed paper" and is used to make items such as masks, bowls, and sculptures.  </p>
